# ewents-rtc

This document explains how to integrate and use the `ewents-rtc` library in your projects. `ewents-rtc` is a library that enables peer-to-peer communication, allowing you to send information from one end to another. From here on, we will refer to the two ends as Peer1 and Peer2 to describe both parties.

Demo:
https://ewents-rtc-example.web.app/

Demo code:
https://github.com/TomasFleitas/rtc-example

### NPM

To install the library using npm, run the following command in your terminal:

```batch
npm install ewents-rtc
```

### Uso

To start using the library after installing it, you need to import it into your projects as follows:

```javascript
import WebRTC from 'ewents-rtc';
```

Generate an instance for each peer you want to communicate with (keep in mind that if the user is communicating with N other users, you need to create 1 pair of peers for each user, meaning USERS = PEERS amount).

#### Example:

CurrentUser needs to connect with User1, User2, and User3.
| Peer1 | Peer2 |
|--------|--------|
|CurrentUser|User1|
|CurrentUser|User2|
|CurrentUser|User3|

---

## Initialization. (Peer1)

```javascript
const webRTC = new WebRTC({
  peerId: peer1-id, // Unique identifier of current peer (Peer1) (optional)
  isSecure: true // if is true, the method startConnection will return a unique secure code to connect with the other peer (optional)
  clientKey: '66760d2b14813c0e8b53b4ff', // Default client key (it will be deleted in the future).
  onReceiveData: (data) => {}, // Data from Peer2 (optional)
  isLog: true, // Allows internal logs to be printed for debugging and monitoring. (optional)
  onReceiveFile: ({ fileName, percentage, file }) => {}, // File from Peer2 (optional)
  onCommunicationState: (state) => {}, // Connection state from Peer2: can be 'none' (no connection), 'connecting' (waiting to connect), 'weak' (text only, no file or video), or 'full' (allows text, file, and video). (optional)
  onReceiveMediaStream: (stream) => {}, // Media streem from Peer2 (optional)
});

Starts a connection with Peer2. You can use `await` to retrieve the secure code if `isSecure` is set to `true` or you can pass a callback function as part of the `opts` object. The `opts` object allows you to configure various connection options, including:

- callback: (optional) A function that will be invoked once the secure code is generated, if `isSecure` is true. The function should accept a single argument `secureCode`.

- secureCode: (optional) A pre-generated secure code that will be used during the connection setup, if `isSecure` is true.

- peerId: (optional) The ID of the current peer initiating the connection.

- isSecure: (optional) A boolean flag indicating whether the connection should be secured with a secure code. When `true`, the secure code will be generated and returned.

- `isLog`: (optional) A boolean flag indicating whether to log the connection process for debugging purposes.


const secureCode = await webRTC.startConnection(peer2Id, {
    callback: (secureCode?: string) => void,
    secureCode: secureCodeFrom,
    peerId: peer-id,
    isSecure: true,
    isLog: true,
});
```

## Initialization. (Peer2)

Same as Peer1, but you should change the peerId and the id that you pass to the `startConnection` method as shown below:

```javascript
const webRTC = new WebRTC({
  peerId: peer2-id, // Unique identifier of current peer (Peer2)
  clientKey: '66760d2b14813c0e8b53b4ff', // Default client key (it will be deleted in the future).
  secureCode: "unique-code" // You can pass the value generated by the other peer either in the constructor or as an optional second parameter in the startConnection method.
  ... // same as Peer1
});
webRTC.startConnection(peer1Id, { secureCode: "unique-code" }); // Start connection with Peer1, optionally passing a secure code for validation.

```

#### Callbacks in another way (using the instance).

```javascript
webRTC.onReceiveData((data) => {}); // Data from Peer2
webRTC.onReceivedFile(({ fileName, percentage, file }) => {}); // File from Peer2
webRTC.onCommunicationState((state) => {}); // Connection state from Peer2: can be 'none' (no connection), 'connecting' (waiting to connect), 'weak' (text only, no file or video), or 'full' (allows text, file, and video).
webRTC.onReceiveMediaStream((stream) => {}); // Media streem from Peer2
```

### Interact with Peer2.

- sendData.

This method allows you to send data to Peer2.

```javascript
webRTC.sendData(any); // Send any data.
```

You can add a callback as the second parameter in the `sendData` method to know the time in milliseconds when Peer2 receives the data.

```javascript
webRTC.sendData(any, ({ ms }) => {}); // Send any data.
```

Additionally, if you use the `await` keyword with the `sendData` method, you will also get the time in milliseconds when Peer2 receives the data.

```javascript
const { ms } = await webRTC.sendData(any); // Send any data.
```

- sendFile

This method allows you to send file data to Peer2.

```javascript
webRTC.sendFile(File); // Send File object (directly from an input type="file")
```

You can add a callback as the second parameter in the `sendFile` method to receive multiple callbacks indicating the percentage of the file transfer, from 0 to 100%.

```javascript
webRTC.sendFile(any, ({ percentage }) => {});
```

- setMediaTracks

The `setMediaTracks` method sets the audio and video tracks for peer-to-peer connection, following the below example:

```javascript
webRTC.setMediaTracks({ audioTrack, videoTrack }, stream);
```

```javascript
const startCall = async () => {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    video: true,
    audio: true,
  });
  const videoTrack = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];
  const audioTrack = stream.getAudioTracks()[0];
  webRTC.setMediaTracks({ audioTrack, videoTrack }, stream);
};
```

Then you can remove tracks using:

```javascript
webRTC.removeMediaTrack('audio');
webRTC.removeMediaTrack('video');
```

or get tracks:

```javascript
webRTC.getMediaTrack('audio');
webRTC.getMediaTrack('video');
```

- closeConnection

This method just closes the connection between peers.

```javascript
webRTC.closeConnection();
```

- Miscellaneous methods:

```javascript
webRTC.getChannelId(); // Retrieve the unique identifier of the peer connection
webRTC.peerType(); // Retrieve the peer type ('unknown' | 'answerer' | 'offerer')
webRTC.isConnected(); // true or false
```

## Deprecated

**⚠️ DEPRECATED: This method is no longer recommended for use.**

Please use the `onCommunicationState()` instead of `onConnectionStateChange()`. The `onCommunicationState()` will be removed in a future release.
